## Version description
% Experiment in which we use a circular full screen 4 directions <br/> 
% (left/right/up/down) bar pass stimuli with an attention task to the bar <br/> 
% in order to obtain pRF retinotopy of the occipital, parietal, frontal <br/> 
% and subcortical structures. <br/> 

% This task is adapted to test condition suppose to mimic symptoms of <br/> 
% amblyopic patients, pRF task is then ran with prisms on the non-dominant<br/> 
% eye (pRFStrab), with an incorrect eye correction on the non-dominant eye<br/> 
% (pRFAniso), and short exposure to a occlusion path on the non-dominant<br/> 
% eye (pRFOccl)or without (pRFCtrl). <br/>
